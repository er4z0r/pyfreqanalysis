# pyfreqanalysis
A simple tool that I wrote in my first semester to experiment with substitution ciphers.

Back in 2011 in my first class on cryptography we were give a ciphertext 
that was encrypted using a simple [substitution cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher). After I had manually
cracked the problem using [frequency analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis#An_example), I hacked together this programm in order facilitate the task in the future.

This is not something you frequently need unless you teach beginners historic
cryptography or for very simple CTF exercises.
